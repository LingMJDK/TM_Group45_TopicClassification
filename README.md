# Text Mining Project: Topic Classification
This repository showcases my implementation of the Topic Classification task as part of a larger Text Mining project. 
The project leverages NLP techniques, focusing on classifying text into predefined topics using models such as RoBERTa and Naive Bayes. 
The dataset consists of diverse texts from domains like sports, movies, and books, which were preprocessed and cleaned before training. 
I collaborated with a partner on the implementation and analysis, and the repository includes the Jupyter notebook and datasets used for the topic classification part.

Note that the provided test set is small, consisting of only 10 instances. It was designed by the professor for a detailed, sentence-by-sentence analysis of the model's performance.
